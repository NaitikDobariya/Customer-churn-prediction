# Customer-churn-prediction
Elementary usage of ML in customer churn prediction 

This repository represents an attempt to explore various classification and regression algorithms using the LazyPredict library for customer churn prediction.

### About the Project

The project utilizes the LazyPredict library to assess the performance of popular classification and regression algorithms for customer churn prediction. LazyPredict is known for its convenience in quickly testing multiple algorithms with minimal code, making it suitable for this project's objective of identifying the most suitable algorithm for the given dataset.

### Kaggle Notebook Link

The project is based on a Kaggle notebook, which can be accessed via this [Kaggle Notebook Link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/dobariyanaitik/customer-churn-prediction-96-58-accuracy). The notebook provides a comprehensive overview of the project's implementation and results.

### Libraries Used

The project leverages various libraries for implementation, including:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- LazyPredict
- LightGBM

### Results

LazyPredict provides us with insights into the best-performing model for the dataset, with LightGBM emerging as the top algorithm. The validation accuracy achieved was 96.58%, which ranks among the highest values observed in notebooks submitted during the Kaggle competition period.
